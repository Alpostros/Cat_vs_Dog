Cat vs Dog Classification

In my free time on the semester break, I finished Standford's online Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng, and I built my first neural network according to the information I learned.
I am currently developing this neural network.
This is a very simple cat vs dog classification, using a Kaggle competition dataset and Google Colab notebook. 
I will continue to optimize this neural network in time to work more efficiently & accurately.
