 Some machine learning projects I create in my free time.

Cat_vs_Dog_DL Description

   In my free time on the semester break, I finished Standford's online Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng, and I built my first neural network according to the information I learned. For my first project, I implemented a convolutional neural network that can classify dogs and cats with 89.5% accuracy. I used Kaggle competition data set and Google Colab notebook. I will continue to optimize this neural network in time my free time to work more efficiently & accurately.
